# YARR - Yet Another Ruddy Roguelike

**NOTE - Development on hold untill I get a new computer**

**Some basic outlining and prototyping may occur as i will try using AIDE, VimTouch and SGit on Android**

YARR aims to be a pirate themed roguelike.

Initially I aim to only support Linux and BSD but may expand support to
OS X and Windows if time permits.

This will be a classic turn-based ASCII roguelike.
